# My Music Playlist

Collection of my favorite contemporary classical music. Almost all of it are instrumentals from video game soundtracks. I choose tracks that either give me energy or relax me. I exclude ones I find depressing or aggresive. I divide them into two directories/albums: ``classical``, which contains more balanced works; and ``soundtracks``, which are more diverse and liberal. In particular, the latter are more oriented towards creating a setting or atmosphere for the video game (such as Japanese, Nordic, Country).

All the tracks have [Replay Gain](https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/playback/replaygain.html) tags. They were generated using my favorite audio player, [QuodLibet](https://quodlibet.readthedocs.io/en/quodlibet-4.6/), with their dedicated plugin. All the files also have basic metadata: Author + Composer, Title, Album, Date (YEAR). However, since getting all the facts is difficult, I only did a basic search online for this information. Therefore, I cannot guarantee the correctness (or, rather, completeness) of these tags. For example, the album names are chosen arbitrarily by me.

The majority of songs were downloaded from YouTube.com on the basis of fair use. For this purpose I used [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#readme). The vast majority of the songs are in Ogg Opus format. However, individual files are Ogg Vorbis and FLAC. Compositions by Paul Anthony Romero and Rob King are in MP3 format. These exceptions exist because they were downloaded directly from the authors in the original format (like [Wesnoth Project](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/tree/master/data/core/music) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/paul-anthony-romero/sets/heroes-of-might-magic-music-by)).

New soundtrack: Wargroove, made by [Pete Lepley (FKA Phonetic Hero)](https://petelepley.bandcamp.com/album/wargroove-original-game-soundtrack). It's absolutely phenomenal, thank you Pete!

Let me know if you enjoy the playlist. I wish you an amazing day!
